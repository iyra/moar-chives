moar-chives is a script designed to back up single webpages by simply 
fetching them and saving them
it also has a functionality for {4,8}chan threads, in which it will save 
the thread
and any images/files linked (including multiple images/files as on 
8chan)

it writes archived files to ./pub/arch and stores lists of them in 
./linkroll.md (simple pages)
and/or ./chanroll.md (imageboard threads)

this means you can use it with `perc' (https://github.com/iyra/perc), 
running from your site directory:
    ../archive.py http://example.com
assuming archive.py is in ~/site and you are in ~/site/example.com

external dependencies: BeautifulSoup (bs4) on Python 3
Future stability is not guaranteed due to "API" changes on imageboard 
sites, use at your own risk.
